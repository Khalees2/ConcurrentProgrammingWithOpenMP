# Parallel-Sum-Reduction-in-OpenMP
OpenMP implemention of the Parallel Sum Reduction operator that computes the sum of a large array of values.

In this assignment one has to develop an efficient implemention of the Parallel Sum Reduction operator that computes the sum of a large array of values in both OpenMP and OpenCL. A prime criterion in the assignment will be the efficiency of both the implementations and the evidence presented to substantiate claims that implementations are efficient.

#### Description and Test results are given in the report.
